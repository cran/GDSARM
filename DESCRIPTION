Description: The method aims to identify important factors in screening experiments by aggregation over random models as studied in Singh and Stufken (2022) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2205.13497>. This package provides functions to run Gauss-Dantzig selector on screening experiments when interactions may be affecting the response. Currently, all functions require each factor to be at two-levels coded as +1 and -1.
