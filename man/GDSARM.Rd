\arguments{
\item{delta.n}{a positive integer suggesting the number of delta values
to be tried. \code{delta.n} equally spaced values of \code{delta} will be used
strictly between 0 and \code{max(|t(X)y|)}. The default value is set to 10.}

\item{nint}{a positive integer representing the number of randomly
chosen interactions. The suggested value to use is the ceiling of 20\%
of the total number of interactions, that is, for \code{m} factors, we have
\code{ceiling(0.2(m choose 2))}.}

\item{nrep}{a positive integer representing the number of times GDS should
be run. The suggested value is \code{(m choose 2)}.}

\item{ntop}{a positive integer representing the number of top models
to be selected among the \code{nrep} models. The suggested value is
\code{max(20, (nrep x nint)/(m(m-1))}. The value of \code{ntop} should not exceed \code{nrep}.}

\item{pkeep}{a number between 0 and 1 representing the proportion of \code{ntop}
models in which an effect needs to appear in order to be selected for the stepwise regression stage.}

\item{design}{a \eqn{n \times m}{n x m} matrix of \code{m} two-level factors.
The levels should be coded as +1 and -1.}

\item{Y}{a vector of \code{n} responses.}

\item{cri.penter}{the p-value cutoff for the most significant effect to enter into the
stepwise regression model. The suggested value is 0.01.}

\item{cri.premove}{the p-value cutoff for the least significant effect to exit from the
stepwise regression model. The suggested value is 0.05.}

\item{opt.heredity}{a string with either \code{none}, or \code{weak}, or \code{strong}. Denotes
whether the effect-heredity (weak or strong) should be embedded in GDS-ARM.
The default value is \code{none} as suggested in Singh and Stufken (2022).}

\item{seedvalue}{a seed value that will fix the set of interactions being
selected. The default value is seed to 1234.}
}
\value{
A list returning the selected effects as well as the
corresponding important factors.

\description{
The GDS-ARM procedure consists of three steps. First, it runs
the Gauss Dantzig Selector (GDS) \code{nrep} times, each time
with a different set of \code{nint} randomly selected two-factor interactions.
All \code{m} main effects are included in each GDS run. Second, the best
\code{ntop} models are identified with the smallest BIC. Effects that
appear in at least \code{pkeep x ntop} of the \code{ntop}
models are then passed on to the third stage. In the third stage, stepwise
regression is used. With
\code{n} being the number of runs, the stepwise regression starts
with at most \code{n-3} selected effects from the previous step. The
remaining effects from the previous step as well as all main effects are
given a chance to enter into the model using the forward-backward stepwise
regression. The function also has the option of using the modified GDS-ARM.
The modified version incorporates effect heredity in two steps, first, for
each model found by GDS, we ignore active interactions when at least one of
the main effects is not active (for weak heredity) or when both main effects are not
active (for strong heredity); and second, we do the same for the model found
after the stepwise stage of GDS-ARM.
